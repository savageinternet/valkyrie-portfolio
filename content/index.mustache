        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <div class="bodytext">
          I am an independent researcher at present; my work is in Human-Computer Interaction, with a focus on input devices and techniques mediated through sensing and digital fabrication. Specifically, I am interested in creating deeply personal interfaces that are adapted to users' bodies, contexts, and needs. <b>I am always open to collaboration.</b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Methodologically, I focus on systems research, where the output of a project is a functional novel system that users can interact with: many of the contributions of this work come from the algorithms required to make these prototypes work, though particularly for sensing research there is a large component of controlled user testing experiments to ensure portability across users and functionality.

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>

        <div class="bodytext">
          I study physical input devices as the ultimate bridge between humans and computers. My work pushes for a world where such devices, whether explicitly-designed or ad hoc, fit a specific user’s needs for a particular time, place, and task, culminating in deeply custom interfaces designed, fabricated, or simply picked up to solve a problem.

          My thesis research, supervised by <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern">Björn Hartmann</a>, focused on digital fabrication and how we can leverage its potential to make prototyping input devices a faster and easier process: this culminated in my dissertation, entitled <a href="/papers/thesis.pdf">“Fabbed to Sense: Integrated Design of Geometry and Sensing for Interactive Objects.”</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZUxloEo4s">A video of my thesis presentation</a> is also available online. I graduated from Indiana University in 2010 with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics, and minors in Psychology and Spanish.<br/><br/>

          More recently, at <a href="https://tactuallabs.com">Tactual Labs</a> I measured human anatomy to richly sense user interactions with existing objects, removing the need for dedicated input devices (under submission). Next, I plan to merge these two approaches and examine how sensing the body and its dynamic capabilities can enhance design of input devices, as well as to expand into task-sensitive sensing—fitting devices to not only their user but their user’s task—and into design support—enabling fluid collaboration around digital designs for interactive physical objects.<br/><br/>

          In the course of doing my own research, I supervised research projects for junior professionals, interns, Masters students, and undergraduates. I also taught UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://cs160.valkyriesavage.com">Introduction to User Interface Design</a> course in Summer 2015 and redesigned the curriculum to incorporate a new technology, replace roughly half the lectures with a studio component, and fit with the summer session timeline.
