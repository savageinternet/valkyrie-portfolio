        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <div class="bodytext">
          I am an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science in the Human-Centred Computing section (DIKU HCC); my work is in Human-Computer Interaction, with a focus on input devices and techniques mediated through sensing and digital fabrication. Specifically, I am interested in creating <b>deeply custom interfaces</b> that are adapted to users' bodies, contexts, and needs.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Methodologically, I focus on systems research, where the output of a project is a functional novel system that users can interact with: many of the contributions of this work come from the algorithms required to make these prototypes work, though particularly for sensing research there is a large component of controlled user testing experiments to ensure portability across users and functionality.
          <br/>

          If you are a master's or bachelor's student at KU, or a student at KU or elsewhere looking for a PhD position, and you would like to work with me, please <a href="#contact">reach out</a>! It will help if you can include context about who you are, what you do, and why you would like to work together (see my <a href="https://valkyriesavage.notion.site/Resources-for-Students-3a49a78e3f584281b4c596ec3875515b">page on doing research with me</a>). I also keep a braindump of <a href="https://valkyriesavage.notion.site/Master-s-and-Bachelor-s-Project-Ideas-743d4e996371487fb74ca5bcf709e283">potentially-interesting master's and bachelor's projects</a> that you are welcome to take a look at.

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>

        <div class="bodytext">
          I study physical input devices as the ultimate bridge between humans and computers. My work pushes for a world where such devices, whether explicitly-designed or ad hoc, fit a specific user’s needs for a particular time, place, and task, culminating in deeply custom interfaces designed, fabricated, or simply picked up to solve a problem.

          My thesis research, supervised by <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern">Björn Hartmann</a>, focused on digital fabrication and how we can leverage its potential to make prototyping input devices a faster and easier process: this culminated in my dissertation, entitled <a href="/papers/thesis.pdf">“Fabbed to Sense: Integrated Design of Geometry and Sensing for Interactive Objects.”</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZUxloEo4s">A video of my thesis presentation</a> is also available online. Thus I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in 2016. Earlier, I graduated from Indiana University in 2010 with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics, and minors in Psychology and Spanish. I have interned at Adobe, Autodesk, and Marvell Semiconductor on various topics during my PhD. After graduating, I worked at <a href="https://tactuallabs.com">Tactual Labs</a> to use anatomical sensing as a way to turn passive objects into input devices.<br/><br/>

          Here at <a href="https://di.ku.dk">DIKU</a>, I'm happy to supervise bachelor and master projects in my area of expertise (3D printing and digital fabrication, sensing, input device design, human-computer interaction). I also maintain a list of <a href="https://valkyriesavage.notion.site/Master-s-and-Bachelor-s-Project-Ideas-743d4e996371487fb74ca5bcf709e283">project ideas</a> that you're welcome to look at; feel free to <a href="#contact">reach out</a> to discuss these ideas or related ones! I love chatting about research.
