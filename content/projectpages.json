    "description": "Locatrix is an app that tracks a user's location and makes it easy to share: the twist is that, instead of sharing a precise location, the app preserves user privacy and safety by only sharing city-level location. This unusual app structure necessitates user education up-front when the app is downloaded, as well as care in design and precision in language, particularly on the interfaces that allow users to share.\nLocatrix comes in two parts: an app which is downloaded to the user's phone and a website which leads the user through configuring their sharing tools. Both parts use the same login information, and also allow the user to log in using a magic link (similar to slack).\nThe app begins with a coverflow that describes the app's usage, and then has a very simple interface which just shows the most recent location recorded and allows the user to force an update (it updates at a random time each day otherwise).\nThe website uses a dynamic form to lead users through configuring a widget for sharing in an email signature or on their blog, or a link which they can share directly.",

    "description": "Zombie Rendezvous is a game designed to be playable in 30 minutes or less by children ages 4-12 who attended an open air science festival in Toronto. The game consists of four stations that players must visit; a zombie, a doctor, a pathologist, and a researcher. The core of the game is a paper booklet, handed to players at the beginning of the game when they are infected by a zombie. Through the course of curing their infection, players learn about the difference between bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, how doctors prevent the spread of diseases, how pathologists grow cultures of diseases, and how researchers design drugs.\nI designed and illustrated the entire booklet, with the exception of the three cover zombies.",

Players encounter a mysterious plot which threatens Canada's Confederation, and must physically travel to downtown locations to solve puzzles in order to stop it. At each location, they meet a historical character and are given a puzzle document, which relies on features of the historical site's environment to solve.\nI am the sole visual designer for the website and puzzle documents, and collaborate on game and puzzle design. I am also the principal UX researcher: I schedule and help run game playtests, design post-test surveys, and collect user interview information during the tests in order to improve the puzzle design.",

A GSM (cellular network) antenna and a GPS antenna attached to a Kinoma Element form the device's functional core, and are enclosed in a custom 3D-printed case.\nAll user-facing communication is performed via text message (SMS). A user may ask 'Where is my bike?' or 'Where did I park?', and in response the Hello, Velo! sends a Google maps link with its current location highlighted. The Hello, Velo! also detects when a user is heading towards their home from their office: at this time, it sends a text message to the user's significant other giving a traffic-adjusted estimated time of arrival at home.\nThis project was completed as a demo to showcase the Internet of Things (IOT) capabilities of the Kinoma Element. I crafted the case, electronics, code, and documentation myself.",

The in-garden device's moisture sensor is built of two nails submerged in plaster; the plaster absorbs water similarly to a plant's stem making this an effective method of measurement. The device also contains a servo which it uses to control water flow through the drip irrigation system. Finally, the device has a simple on-board microcontroller and XBee radio which it uses to update a server's record of its moisture as well as to query the server for optimal or desired watering settings. I designed the web interface and electronics code.",
